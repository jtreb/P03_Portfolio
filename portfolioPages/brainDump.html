      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>The Brain Dump is a place where some of my raw and un-polished artwork is placed! Think of this place as the reflection of how my mind works, and this also represents the "messy-ness" that happens before the professional and the publishing comes in. That being said, this also contains some artwork that I created in my own time for fun and practices. This is my way of saying, I'm human too and everything that comes with that.</p>

    <section class="sectionContent" id="wallpapersSection">
      <h2>Low-poly Wallpapers</h2>
      <p>This section contains some wallpapers I have made for practicing 3D modelling and overall fun. My main motivation for creating these is my friend. These wallpapers were requested by him and he uses them as wallpapers for his Surface Pro to this day.</p>

      <h3>Low Poly Earth</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/polygoneImages/lowPolyEarth.jpg" alt="A low-poly 3D model of Earth in outer space">
        <figcaption>The first wallpaper I created for him. I was still fairly new to low-poly and using Maya as well.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Low Poly Halloween</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="../img/polygoneImages/lowPolyHalloween.jpg" alt="A low-poly 3D model of a Halloween-themed landscape">
        <figcaption>This is a halloween-themed wallpaper inspired from the hill in the Nightmare Before Christmas.</figcaption>

    <section class="sectionContent" id="doodlesSection">
      <h2>Doodles</h2>
      <p>These doodles were all drawn and coloured in a mobile app called "Sketch". I would visit this app every time I was bored, procastinating, or even in-class. Sketch is my go-to app when I want to write down quick notes, doodle "curves" or draw characters. Much of these doodles were inspired from existing characters such as Zyra, Lissandra, and Evelynn from "League of Legends", or the leaders in "Duelyst". Although I am interested in 3D Modelling, one secondary goals is to become proficient in character concepts/creation. If I really like the character, I would draw them in Sketch.</p>
