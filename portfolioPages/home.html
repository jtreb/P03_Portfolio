      <h2>About Polygone</h2>
      <p>Polygone is the outcome for our final group project in our animation class at Simon Fraser University (SFU). The task was to create and show a narrative through animations using mainly Autodesk Maya. We were encouraged to create our own models, environments, and animations. However, our team decided to create all the models in our animation to push ourselves into creating our -own- project without the help of external ready-made assets.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>

      <h3>Discovery</h3>
      <p>During our studio lab sessions, one of our tutorials consisted of teaching how to create 3D compositions with a low-poly aesthetic. Our teaching assistant introduced a 3D modeler artist named Timothy J. Reynolds and I immediately realized here that I loved this form of aesthetic and was motivated to practice more of this art-style in my free time.</p>

      <h3>Practice</h3>
      <p>Of course, I was highly inexperienced and new to this type of art form, especially in using Maya, so I practiced. I created various crude forms of low-poly art style. I watched YouTube tutorial videos, kept links of various “how to’s” for future references. In-between my other school projects and assignments, I made time to practice; simply because I had fun creating them. I enjoyed the struggle of figuring out the technical skills in Maya and the reward of finally seeing the final render in Photoshop.</p>

      <p>When I was confident, I tried to recreate one of Timothy’s artwork, called “Island”.</p>

      <p>Creating a low-poly environment initially consists of three layers created in Maya: colour layer, occlusion layer, light layer. Then I combined the three layers by multiplying the layers, enhancing/adjusting it in Photoshop, in which is finalized into a low-poly composition.</p>

      <p>From here on I continued to create and experiment with low-poly aesthetic in Maya and combining it in Photoshop.</p>
